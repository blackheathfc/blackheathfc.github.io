## Parking

There will be traffic marshals on hand to help with directions. There are a limited number of car park spaces in public car parks at both entrances.  

Additional on-street parking (shown as a thick blue line on the map) is available when the car parks are full.

The car parks and parking spaces are open to the public and and will fill up quickly so we advise you arrive early.

We ask that you show consideration to the local residents. All drivers park at their own risk. We would appreciate that you please car-share wherever possible to both reduce your carbon footprint and assist with overflow parking issues.

## Getting in

Having parked up, pedestrian entrance to the site is via four access points near the car parks.

We ask that **all** adults, whether arriving by car or as a pedestrian, purchase a programme. The programme is **£4** and our programme sellers will be on hand to ensure that the purchases do not cause any delay to getting into the festival site. It would be very helpful if you could have the correct
change, please. 

All money from programme sales helps subsidise the upcoming tour for the organising age group, Blackheath U10s.
