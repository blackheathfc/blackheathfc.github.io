# On the day

Once you're here, here are some bits of information you might find helpful:

## Registration

All participating teams need to hand in a registration form per team for their respective age groups at the Control Tent before 09:30. Blank registration forms can be found [here](../registration_form)
 

## Gazebos

We would ask you to please consult with pitch marshals for the erection of gazebos and keep structures at least 5 metres away from pitches, footpaths and access roads

## Matches

The match schedule for your age group will be updated on the morning of the festival and is available to view on signage at the pitch marshals’ control tent in your age group area and on our website.

## Festival Makers

There will be a number of Festival Makers across the Festival site to help you with directions and answer any questions you may have. They will be fully briefed and are there to ensure all goes smoothly. They will be easily spotted wearing his-vis vests.

## Referees

For each match, the two teams' coaches should agree who is refereeing. There will not be referees from other clubs assigned to your games.

The referees briefing for your age group at the age group pitch marshall’s tent will clarify refereeing arrangements. Referee's briefing notes are available on our website.

## Visitor Safety

Lost children should be taken to the main control festival tent.  Please supervise your children closely particularly in the vicinity of the car parking and exits to the grounds. In the event of an emergency, please listen carefully to the instructions given by the pitch marshals.

## Medical

A team of first aiders will be on site. Should there be a medical incident please let the pitch marshal know. That person will then liaise with the control tent. A further decision regarding additional care will then be made.

## Health and safety during matches

For the U9s to U11s contact matches, at the beginning of each match the referee should undertake a stud and fingernail check. Please ensure that these are in good condition before players line up to avoid any delay in match start times.

## Safety on and near the pitches

Only coaches / players wearing boots with studs are allowed on the pitches and visitors should remain at least two metres away from the cones marking the pitch space. Please make sure that enough space is provided along the sides of the pitches for a touch judge to run the line.

## Rubbish

Rubbish bags will be given to all teams entered and we would like to ask all teams to make sure that they collect the rubbish around their team locations before leaving the event. Due to the scale of the event, it will be difficult for the Club to separate out recyclable materials – if you are able to take
recyclables home with you then we would welcome your support to keep our event as green as possible.

## Toilet facilities

Portaloos are located in two separate locations marked with WC on the pitch plan. There are also further toilet facilities available in the changing rooms behind the cafe.

## Refreshments

There will be hot and cold refreshments on sale during the festival from 08:00. Hot breakfast will be available early on with bacon rolls etc. and further hot food options around lunch time. In addition there will be a cake stall.

Soft drinks and coffee and tea will also be available at several points. 

## Bar
There is no bar on site at Avery Hill Park. However, we welcome all parents, coaches and their players back to our clubhouse not far away at **Kidbrooke Lane, Well Hall, Eltham, SE9 6TE** for refreshments after the trophies and badges ceremony closes. There are plenty of parking spaces on site at Well Hall, and it would be great to extend our day of rugby with our guest clubs.

## Photography

In accordance with the RFU best practice guidelines on taking photographic images, we will be seeking parents' or guardians' guidance relating to photography of players. To keep this as simple as possible, the team registration sheet contains a signature box for a parent or guardian of each player to sign if they want us to avoid photography of that player. If a parent does not want their child photographed, this should also be communicated to the pitch marshal who will do their best to ensure this does not happen.

Please note, though, that the festival takes place in a public place and members of the public are entitled to photograph anything while they are there. We can only communicate carers' preference to bystanders.

A professional photographer from DE Photo will be onsite where high quality action shots can be purchased on the day.

## Security

The festival is held on public land. Please ensure belongings are kept safe. Blackheath Football Club cannot accept responsibility for any losses.

## Presentations

Presentations of trophies for fair play, along with badges, will take place at the presentation area with our sponsors Stephen James BMW and former Blackheath and England international Mickey Skinner.

This will be located within each age group pitch marshal’s tent immediately following the relevant final match. Further details will be provided by the pitch marshals. So please don’t shoot off and miss the ceremony!

## Lost Property

This will be kept at the main festival control tent.

## Festival Welfare Plan

The festival organisers recognise their responsibility to ensure the welfare of all the young people who participate in today’s festival. The welfare plan requires that:

* All adults attending the festival are aware of and conform to the RFU Fair Play Codes, RFU Codes of Conduct for Coaches in accordance with the RFU Safeguarding Policy Guidance and Procedures which is available for inspection at the main festival control tent.

* All coaches/team managers recognise their responsibility for the safety and well being of the youngsters, both on and off the field.

* All young players play within the laws of the game, show respect to their coaches, the match officials and other players.
